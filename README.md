## How to run

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Node server**

   ```sh
   node tracks-server.js
   ```

   This serves your tracks and API at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

3. **Start the Vite dev server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This serves the Vue app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

   **If you are using Live Share and want others to access your Vite server:**
   Start Vite with the `--host` flag:

   ```sh
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

   This makes Vite accessible on your network IP, so Live Share guests can access it when you share the port (usually 5173).

4. **Open your browser**
   - Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to use the webb app
