# React + Vite + grcode + tailwindcss || Webb app starting template

This is a template that provides a minimal setup to get started with a react website styled with tailwindcss with some components or not depending on what branch you chose to use 

Main = includes components + react router
BareBone = no extra components

## How the site works

- just a simple template click on use this template and use it
- if you are looking for a minimal no component starting point take a look at the BareBone branch 

## How to run

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Vite dev server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This serves the Vue app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

   **If you are using Live Share and want others to access your Vite server:**
   Start Vite with the `--host` flag:

   ```sh
   npm run dev -- --host
   ```

   This makes Vite accessible on your network IP, so Live Share guests can access it when you share the port (usually 5173).
